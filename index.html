        <!-- A. -->
    <h3>a. What is HTML, and why is it important in web development?</h3>
        <!-- answer a -->
    <li>HTML serves as the backbone of every website, providing the essential structure upon which all web pages are built.</li>  
        <!-- B. -->
    <h3>b. What are HTML extensions, and how do they function? </h3>
        <!-- answer b -->
        <li>HTML files are typically saved with extensions like .html or .htm, which tell web browsers to interpret and display them as web pages.</li>
        <li>HTML extensions can also refer to additional tools or technologies that expand HTML's capabilities, such as developer browser add-ons or HTML5 features that enhance website functionality.</li>

        <!-- C. -->
    <h3>c. What are some commonly used HTML editors? Provide at least two examples and their key features.</h3>

<h2 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Section 2: HTML Elements and Tags</h1>
 
         <!-- a. -->
    <h3>a. What is the difference between an HTML element and an HTML tag?</h3>
         <!-- answer a -->
    <li>HTML is the language used to create and structure web pages, while an HTML tag is a specific element within that language used to define parts of the content (like < p > for paragraph or < h1 > for heading).</li>
    <li>HTML refers to the entire framework or code used for building websites, whereas an HTML tag is one of the building blocks within that code that tells the browser how to display certain elements.</li>

          <!-- b -->
    <h3>b. List and describe the purpose of the following tags:</h3>
        <!-- answer b -->
       <li> < html > - Defines the beginning and end of an HTML document. It wraps all the content on the page.</li>

       <li> < head > - Contains meta-information about the document (e.g., title, character set, links to CSS or JavaScript).</li>
        
        <li> < title > - Sets the title of the web page, which appears in the browser tab.</li>
         <!-- section 3 -->
    <h2 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Section 3: Attributes and Best Practices</h1>
         <!-- answer a. -->
    <h3>a. What are HTML tag attributes? Provide three examples and their functions.</h3>
    <p>
        href (used in < a > tag)
            <br>
            Function: Specifies the URL the link goes to.
            Example: < a href="https://example.com">Visit< /a >
            src (used in < img > tag)
            <br>

            Function: Defines the path to the image file.
            Example: < img src="image.jpg" alt="Sample Image" >
            alt (used in < img > tag)
            <br>
 
            Function: Provides alternative text if the image can't be displayed (also helps with accessibility).
            Example: < img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo" >
    </p>
         <!-- answer b. -->
    <h3>b. What are some useful tips for writing clean and efficient HTML code?</h3>
    <li>Use proper indentation.</li>
    <li>Close all tags properly.</li>
    <li>Use meaningful tag names.</li>
    <li>Add comments for clarity.</li>
    <li>Keep code simple and organized.</li>
